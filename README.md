# Review_Scrapper_Flipkart

Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping consists of two parts:
• Web Crawling: Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from them.
• HTML Parsing: Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web crawling and then extracting specific information from it.

#### Review Scrapper pulls the reviews of the product from the particular URL which we mention in our code. In this project we are getting reviews of any product in flipkart with Name, Rating and Comment.
